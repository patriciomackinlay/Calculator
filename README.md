# Calculator
The Odin Project - Calculator

In this project, I will create a calculator with basic operations (sum, subtract, multiply & divide).
As the final project for the Foundations course, I'll try to apply everything I've learned so far about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
My goal for this project is to have a good looking UI, and a bug-free experience for the program.
